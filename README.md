This landing page is a restaurant's complete, responsive Landing Page developed without the use of JavaScript or any external frameworks. This project focuses on building a fully responsive Landing Page, fully responsive across all three device types: Mobile, Tablet and Desktop.

The website offers a completely responsive user interface that provides flexibility for the website owner through the use of modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox, Grid and Media Queries. The Landing Page features a restaurant-centric UI that incorporates Navigation, Promotion and an Image Gallery.
